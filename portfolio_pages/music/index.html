            <p>
              Back in my early days, listening to music wasn’t as easy as it is now. 
              You had to buy CDs or DVDs to enjoy an album. There was an old cassette player at home, 
              but it broke down before I even figured out how to use it. I still remember a TV program that aired every Friday at 1:30 PM, 
              showcasing song and album advertisements. I eagerly waited for it every week and ended up memorizing all the songs. 
              I was probably seven years old at the time.
              <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1" style="display: none;">
                <br><br>
                One day in school, our teacher said, “We’ve completed the syllabus, and since no one has any questions, let’s spend the time listening to songs. 
                If anyone wants to sing, come up and perform.” My friends, knowing how much I loved singing, pushed me to go up that day. 
                That became my very first performance. The whole class cheered and clapped, and I felt incredibly happy. 
                From that moment on, I started singing in class whenever there was an opportunity—especially when we had free time after finishing the syllabus. 
                My teachers were always supportive, and my friends Shrestho, Farhan, Talha, Tonmoy also joined me on the stage. 
                Farhan and Talha were the percussionists, making our little music sessions even more special.
                
                That is how my live performing ability and confidence has grown. I am thankful to all my friends, my classmates who always appreciated me, cheered 
                for me and gave me the support. My family never complained as long as my result is good.

            </header>

            <p>
              On April 4, 2010, I bought my first guitar and started learning at Ghashful Art School with my friends. 
              That was the first time I heard someone play the guitar live—our teacher, Mithu Qureshi. 
              We took lessons and tried to complete them with the highest accuracy possible. 
              There was always a competition between me and Shrestho. We pushed each other whenever a new lesson came up. 
              It actually helped both of us, as we were the only two who didn’t give up learning the guitar.
            </p>

            <button id="read-more-btn-overview" class="button">Read More</button>

            <div id="more-content-overview" style="display: none;">
              <p>
                After about a year, we joined another school called Shatrong, where we trained under guitarist Shukhon Zaman. 
                His approach was different from our first teacher’s, and as a result, our playing styles evolved. During this time, we covered many songs and slowly became popular in school. 
                That’s when I decided to start a band.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I was in class 10, I started jamming at my friend Tanvir’s house, along with Farhan, Hasib, and Tonmoy. Eventually, Tanvir and I bought electric guitars and formed a band called Babodhan. 
                We released a single in 2013, called "Amar Janala," in a band compilation album called "Kritodash." We also played some good gigs. For a brief period, I also played in a band called "ThikanaHin."
              </p>

              <p>
                However, after school, everyone got admitted into different colleges, and we couldn’t continue. So, I started playing alone at home, 
                learning from YouTube videos, and composing some songs. Incidentally, Rishal joined me as my guitar partner. 
                He was the one who could match my energy while playing, so I could focus on singing. We played in shows, rooftops, and universities.
                I took lyrics from the poetry of my friend Azmain Haq and composed some songs, notably the "Rainy Blues" series.
              </p>

              <p>
                Later, I started making music with Akram Bhai, Rabby Bhai, and Russel Bhai, forming a band that, unfortunately, didn’t last long. 
                Even though the band dissolved, they remain my close brothers, and we created a lot of music together. 
                I truly miss that band from the core of my heart. Fast forward to 2017, I joined my dream band, "Shohortoli." 
                I played in two gigs with them but eventually didn’t continue for various reasons. After all this, I decided not to form another band. Instead, I focused on improving myself first.
              </p>

              <p>
                At university, my genre shifted toward Indian Classical Music. I realized that I needed to practice a lot more if I wanted to become a professional vocalist. 
                Otherwise, I would end up being a mediocre artist, which I didn’t want to become. So, I started practicing seriously, and my vocal skills improved significantly. 
                However, I never became a great Indian classical musician.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most of the time after school, I sang on rooftops and received admiration from various people, for which I am truly grateful. 
                Without music, I would never have realized how much people love to hear my voice sing, and my hands play the guitar.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note: This is just a short brief. Someday, I wish to elaborate the story even more.
